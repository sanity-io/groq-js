# GROQ-JS

GROQ-JS is a (work-in-progress) JavaScript implementation of [GROQ](https://www.sanity.io/docs/data-store/how-queries-work) which follows the official specification.

```javascript
import {parse, evaluate} from 'groq-js'

let input = '*[_type == "user"]{name}'

// Returns an ESTree-inspired syntax tree
let tree = parse(input)

let dataset = [
  {_type: 'user', name: 'Michael'},
  {_type: 'company', name: 'Bluth Company'}
]

// Evaluate a tree against a dataset
let value = await evaluate(tree, {dataset})

// Gather everything into one JavaScript object
let result = await value.get()

console.log(result)
```

## Versioning

GROQ-JS follows [SemVer](https://semver.org) and is currently at version v0.2.
See [the changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for recent changes.
This is an "experimental" release and anything _may_ change at any time, but we're trying to keep changes as minimal as possible:

- The public API of the parser/evaluator will most likely stay the same in future version.
- The syntax tree is _not_ considered a public API and may change at any time.
- This package always implements the latest version of [GROQ according to the specification](https://github.com/sanity-io/groq).
- The goal is to release a v1.0.0 by the end of 2020.

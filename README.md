# GROQ-JS

GROQ-JS is a (work-in-progress) JavaScript implementation of [GROQ](https://www.sanity.io/docs/data-store/how-queries-work) which follows the official specification.

```javascript
import {parse, evaluate} from 'groq-js'

let input = '*[_type == "user"]{name}'

// Returns an ESTree-inspired syntax tree
let tree = parse(input)

let documents = [
  {_type: "user", name: "Michael"},
  {_type: "company", name: "Bluth Company"}
]

// Evaluate a tree against a set of documents
let value = await evaluate(tree, {documents})

// Gather everything into one JavaScript object
let result = await value.get()

console.log(result)
```

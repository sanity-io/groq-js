GROQ-JS is a JavaScript implementation of [GROQ](https://www.sanity.io/docs/data-store/how-queries-work) which follows the official specification.

```javascript
import {parse, evaluate} from 'groq-js'

let input = '*[_type == "user"]{name}'

// Returns an ESTree-inspired syntax tree
let tree = parse(input)

let dataset = [
  {_type: 'user', name: 'Michael'},
  {_type: 'company', name: 'Bluth Company'},
]

// Evaluate a tree against a dataset
let value = await evaluate(tree, {dataset})

// Gather everything into one JavaScript object
let result = await value.get()

console.log(result)
```

## Learn GROQ

## Versioning

### GROQ

The GROQ spec version is independent of the groq-js library version. When you import groq-js you need to be explicit on which GROQ version you want to use. The GROQ version is tied to the [groq-spec](https://github.com/sanity-io/groq). This allows us to update the library and its API independent of the GROQ version.

### GROQ-JS

GROQ-JS follows [SemVer](https://semver.org).
See [the changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for recent changes.
This is an "experimental" release and anything _may_ change at any time, but we're trying to keep changes as minimal as possible:

- The public API of the parser/evaluator will most likely stay the same in future versions.
- The syntax tree is _not_ considered a public API and may change at any time.
- This package always implements the latest version of [GROQ according to the specification](https://github.com/sanity-io/groq).

## Releasing a new version of GROQ-JS

Run the ["CI & Release" workflow](https://github.com/sanity-io/groq-js/actions/workflows/test.yml). Make sure to select the main branch and check "Release new version".

Version will be automatically bumped based on [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) since the last release.

Semantic release will only release on configured branches, so it is safe to run release on any branch.

Note: commits with `chore:` will be ignored. If you want updated dependencies to trigger
a new version, use `fix(deps):` instead.

## Tests

Tests are written in [Jest](https://jestjs.io/):

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Run tests
npm test
```

You can also generate tests from [the official GROQ test suite](https://github.com/sanity-io/groq-test-suite):

```bash
# Fetch and generate test file:
./test/generate.sh

# Run tests as usual:
npm test
```

You can generate tests from a specific version:

```shell
GROQTEST_SUITE_VERSION=v0.1.33 ./test/generate.sh
```

or from a file (as generated by the test suite):

```shell
GROQTEST_SUITE=suite.ndjson ./test/generate.sh
```

The test arguments are passed to `tap`, so you can use arguments, e.g. to run a specific set of tests:

```shell
npm test -g "array::join"
```
